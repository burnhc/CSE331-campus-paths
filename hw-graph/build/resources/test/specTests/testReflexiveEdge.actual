# Tests that a reflexive edge (an edge that connects a node to
# itself) is represented properly.

# Create a new graph.
created graph graph1

# Add a single node.
added node n1 to graph1

# Add a edge connecting the node to itself.
added edge edge1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print all the nodes in the graph and the children of n1.
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(edge1)
