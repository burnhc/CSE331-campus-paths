# Tests createGraph, addNode, and getNodes with near-identical
# operations to ensure multiple graphs do not modify each other.

# Create two new graphs.
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Add two nodes to graph1 and graph2.
added node n1 to graph1
added node n1 to graph2
added node n2 to graph1
added node n2 to graph2

# Print all the nodes in each graph.
graph1 contains: n1 n2
graph2 contains: n1 n2

# Add another node to graph2.
added node n3 to graph2

# Print all the nodes in each graph.
graph1 contains: n1 n2
graph2 contains: n1 n2 n3
