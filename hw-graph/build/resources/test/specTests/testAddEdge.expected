# Tests addNode and listChildren to check if new edges are created properly.
# Creates three edges from three nodes and then prints the children of n1.

# Create a new graph.
created graph graph1

# Add three nodes to the graph.
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Create three edges between the three nodes.
added edge edge1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge edge3 from n2 to n3 in graph1

# Print all the nodes in the graph and the children of n1.
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(edge1) n3(edge2)
