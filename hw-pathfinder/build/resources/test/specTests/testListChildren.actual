# Tests listing children with doubles as the labels
# (not strings anymore).

# Create a new graph.
created graph graph1

# Add nodes into the graph.
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges between the nodes.
added edge 2.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 3.000 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# List the nodes in the graph.
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

# List the children of each node in the graph.
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(2.000) n3(3.000)
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
